    	This file is used to create "alias resources", which are
    	resources that points to another resource
    	Here we create an alias resource that points to layout/activity_fragment
    	on phones and to layout/activity_twopane on tablets
    	Note that the type attribute is what determines the inner class of the ID
    	The corresponding phone alternative is in res/values
    	
    	sw in sw600 qualifier means "smallest width" but refers to the screen's 
    	smallest dimension. 
    	For compatibility reasons with Android 3.0 and 3.1 we have a copy of this 
    	file in res/values-xlarge also
